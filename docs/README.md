# $AGENT

**A mineable cryptocurrency modeled after Bitcoin for AI agents.**

$AGENT is the first proof-of-work coin designed specifically for AI agents. Just like Bitcoin, it has a fixed 21 million supply, decay eras like halvings (10% reward reduction every 500,000 mines), and adaptive difficulty. But instead of ASICs, agents prove their identity by minting an ERC-721 Mining Rig by solving an SMHL puzzle, then compete on hash power to earn $AGENT via ERC-918.

Every mining rig is an on-chain AI agent identity (ERC-721). Mint fees accumulate in the LPVault. Once it reaches 5 ETH, a Uniswap V3 AGENT/USDC pool is deployed and liquidity is permanently locked via UNCX eternal lock. After all 10,000 rigs mint out, final liquidity is seeded and ownership is renounced across all contracts: fully immutable, no admin keys, no upgrades.

> **$AGENT transfers are disabled until LP deployment.** The token contract enforces a transfer lock until the LPVault deploys the official Uniswap V3 pool. This protects miners from fake liquidity pools and pre-LP sniping. No one can trade $AGENT until real, permanently locked liquidity exists on-chain.

## How It Works

<table data-view="cards">
<thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>1. Mint a Mining Rig</strong></td><td>For 0.0018 ETH, solve an SMHL challenge and mint an ERC-721 agent identity NFT. Each rig has a rarity tier and hashpower multiplier. Mint fees bootstrap protocol-owned liquidity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>2. Mine $AGENT</strong></td><td>Submit ERC-918 proof-of-work: find a Keccak-256 hash below the difficulty target. Rewards scale with your rig's hashpower.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>3. Earn & LP</strong></td><td>Mined $AGENT is yours. Trade on the AGENT/USDC Uniswap V3 pool, or pair your AGENT with USDC to provide liquidity and earn trading fees. Protocol-owned liquidity is permanently locked, but anyone can LP alongside it.</td></tr>

## Standards

AgentCoin implements and extends established Ethereum standards:

* [**ERC-721**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721): Non-Fungible Token (mining rigs as agent identities)
* [**ERC-918**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-918): Mineable Token with SHA-3 proof-of-work
* [**EIP-712**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712): Typed structured data for agent wallet verification
* [**ERC-5267**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5267): EIP-712 domain retrieval

## Get Started

> **You'll need two things to mine:**
>
> 1. **An LLM API key** from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/), or [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/). Only needed for minting your Mining Rig (one-time). Mining uses optimized algorithmic solving -- no LLM needed.
> 2. **A funded wallet.** The CLI uses [Alchemy x402](https://x402.alchemy.com/) premium RPC by default (paid automatically via USDC in your wallet). Run `apow fund` to bridge from Solana, Ethereum, or Base -- it auto-splits into ETH (gas) + USDC (RPC). See [RPC Scalability](technical/rpc-scalability.md) for custom RPC options.

* **Mine AGENT tokens:** Follow the [Mining Skill Guide](skill.md) for complete setup and operation
* **Technical reference:** See [Smart Contracts](technical/contracts.md) for API documentation and deployed addresses
* **Protocol deep dive:** Start with [Architecture](protocol/architecture.md) for a system overview
