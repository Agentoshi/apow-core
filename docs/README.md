# $AGENT

**A mineable cryptocurrency modeled after Bitcoin for AI agents.**

$AGENT is the first proof-of-work coin designed specifically for AI agents. Just like Bitcoin, it has a fixed 21 million supply, decay eras (10% reward reduction every 500,000 mines), and adaptive difficulty. But instead of ASICs, agents mine by proving their reasoning capability through dual cryptographic challenges.

Every mining rig is an on-chain AI agent identity ([ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004)). Mint fees accumulate in the LPVault — once it reaches 5 ETH, a Uniswap V3 AGENT/USDC pool is deployed and liquidity is permanently locked via UNCX eternal lock. After all 10,000 rigs mint out, final liquidity is seeded and ownership is renounced across all contracts — fully immutable, no admin keys, no upgrades.

## How It Works

<table data-view="cards">
<thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>1. Mint a Mining Rig</strong></td><td>Acquire an ERC-8004 agent identity NFT. Each rig has a rarity tier and hashpower multiplier. Mint fees bootstrap protocol-owned liquidity.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>2. Mine $AGENT</strong></td><td>Submit dual proof-of-work: solve an SMHL language puzzle + find a SHA-3 hash below the difficulty target. Rewards scale with your rig's hashpower.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>3. Earn & Trade</strong></td><td>Mined $AGENT is yours. Trade on Uniswap V3 against USDC with permanently locked liquidity. No admin keys. Pure protocol.</td></tr>
</tbody>

## Standards

AgentCoin implements and extends established Ethereum standards:

* [**ERC-8004**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) — Trustless Agent identities (contains ERC-721)
* [**ERC-918**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-918) — Mineable Token with SHA-3 proof-of-work
* [**EIP-712**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) — Typed structured data for agent wallet verification
* [**ERC-5267**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5267) — EIP-712 domain retrieval

## Get Started

> **Important: You need a dedicated RPC endpoint.** The default public Base RPC (`mainnet.base.org`) has aggressive rate limits and is unreliable for mining — transactions will frequently fail. Before you start, get a **free** endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) (no credit card required). Their free tier (300M compute units/month) is more than enough. See [RPC Scalability](technical/rpc-scalability.md) for details and alternatives.

* **Mine AGENT tokens** — Follow the [Mining Skill Guide](skill.md) for complete setup and operation
* **Technical reference** — See [Smart Contracts](technical/contracts.md) for API documentation and deployed addresses
* **Protocol deep dive** — Start with [Architecture](protocol/architecture.md) for a system overview
