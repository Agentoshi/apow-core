# APoW Mining Skill

> A self-contained guide for any AI agent to go from zero knowledge to actively mining AGENT tokens on Base.

---

## 1. What is APoW?

Agent Proof-of-Work (APoW) is a mining protocol where AI agents solve constrained string-generation challenges called SMHL ("show me how to live") to mine AGENT tokens on the Base L2 network. Mining requires owning a Miner NFT (ERC-721 with rarity-based hashpower) and access to an LLM that can solve the SMHL constraints. Rewards start at 3 AGENT per mine (scaled by hashpower) and decay by 10% every 500,000 total network mines, with a hard cap of 21,000,000 AGENT.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| **Node.js** | v18 or higher |
| **Base wallet** | A private key with ETH on Base (for gas + mint fee) |
| **LLM API key** | OpenAI, Anthropic, or a local Ollama instance |
| **git** | To clone the repository |

---

## 3. Step 1: Create a Base Wallet

**Option A -- Foundry (`cast`)**
```bash
cast wallet new
```
This outputs an address and private key. Save the private key (0x-prefixed, 64 hex characters).

**Option B -- Any wallet generator**
Use viem, ethers.js, MetaMask, or any tool that produces a standard Ethereum private key.

**Fund the wallet:**
- Bridge ETH from Ethereum mainnet via [bridge.base.org](https://bridge.base.org)
- Or transfer ETH directly from another Base wallet
- **Minimum recommended balance:** 0.005 ETH (covers minting + several mining cycles)
  - Mint fee: 0.002 ETH (max price at token #1, decays over time)
  - Each mine transaction: ~0.001 ETH gas

---

## 4. Step 2: Install Miner Client

```bash
git clone https://github.com/APoW-Protocol/APoW.git
cd APoW/miner
npm install
```

The miner is a TypeScript CLI built with Commander.js. It has four commands: `setup`, `mint`, `mine`, and `stats`.

---

## 5. Step 3: Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the `miner/` directory:

```bash
# === Required ===

# Your wallet private key (0x-prefixed, 64 hex chars)
PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE

# Deployed contract addresses (set after mainnet deployment)
MINING_AGENT_ADDRESS=0xTBD
AGENT_COIN_ADDRESS=0xTBD

# === LLM Configuration ===

# Provider: "openai" | "anthropic" | "ollama"
LLM_PROVIDER=openai

# API key (not required if LLM_PROVIDER=ollama)
LLM_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key

# Model name (provider-specific)
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o

# === Network ===

# Base RPC endpoint (default: https://mainnet.base.org)
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.base.org

# Chain: "base" | "baseSepolia" (auto-detected from RPC_URL if omitted)
CHAIN=base
```

### Environment Variable Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | Yes | -- | Wallet private key (0x + 64 hex chars) |
| `MINING_AGENT_ADDRESS` | Yes | -- | Deployed MiningAgent contract address |
| `AGENT_COIN_ADDRESS` | Yes | -- | Deployed AgentCoin contract address |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | No | `openai` | LLM provider: `openai`, `anthropic`, or `ollama` |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Conditional | -- | Required for `openai` and `anthropic`, not needed for `ollama` |
| `LLM_MODEL` | No | `gpt-4o` | Model identifier passed to the provider |
| `RPC_URL` | No | `https://mainnet.base.org` | Base JSON-RPC endpoint |
| `CHAIN` | No | `base` | Network selector; auto-detects `baseSepolia` if RPC URL contains "sepolia" |

### LLM Provider Recommendations

| Provider | Model | Cost per call | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | `gpt-4o-mini` | ~$0.001 | Cheapest cloud option |
| OpenAI | `gpt-4o` | ~$0.005 | Default; good reliability |
| Anthropic | `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` | ~$0.005 | High accuracy on constrained generation |
| Ollama | `llama3.1` | Free (local) | Requires local GPU; variable accuracy |

### RPC Recommendations

The default `https://mainnet.base.org` is rate-limited. For production mining, use a dedicated RPC:
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) -- `https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY`
- [Infura](https://infura.io/) -- `https://base-mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY`
- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/) -- custom endpoint

## 6. Step 4: Mint a Mining Rig

```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts mint
```

**What happens:**
1. The client calls `getChallenge(yourAddress)` on the MiningAgent contract, which generates a random SMHL challenge and stores the seed on-chain. This is a write transaction (costs gas).
2. The client derives the challenge parameters from the stored seed and sends them to your LLM.
3. The LLM generates a sentence matching the constraints (approximate length, approximate word count, must contain a specific letter).
4. The client calls `mint(solution)` with the mint fee attached. The contract verifies the SMHL solution on-chain.
5. On success, an ERC-721 Miner NFT is minted to your wallet with a randomly determined rarity and hashpower.
6. The mint fee is forwarded to the LPVault (used for AGENT/USDC liquidity — initial LP deployment at threshold, then ongoing `addLiquidity()` to deepen the position).

**Challenge expiry:** 20 seconds from `getChallenge` to `mint`. The LLM must solve quickly.

### Mint Price

The mint price starts at 0.002 ETH and decays exponentially:
- Decreases by 5% every 100 mints
- Floors at 0.0002 ETH
- Formula: `price = max(0.002 * 0.95^(totalMinted / 100), 0.0002)` ETH

### Rarity Table

| Tier | Name | Hashpower | Reward Multiplier | Probability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Common | 100 | 1.00x | 60% |
| 1 | Uncommon | 150 | 1.50x | 25% |
| 2 | Rare | 200 | 2.00x | 10% |
| 3 | Epic | 300 | 3.00x | 4% |
| 4 | Mythic | 500 | 5.00x | 1% |

**Max supply:** 10,000 Miner NFTs.

---

## 7. Step 5: Start Mining

```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts mine <tokenId>
```

Replace `<tokenId>` with the token ID printed after minting (e.g., `npx tsx src/index.ts mine 42`).

### What Each Mining Cycle Does

1. **Ownership check** -- verifies your wallet owns the specified token.
2. **Supply check** -- confirms mineable supply is not exhausted.
3. **Fetch challenge** -- reads `getMiningChallenge()` from the AgentCoin contract, which returns:
   - `challengeNumber` (bytes32) -- the current PoW challenge hash
   - `miningTarget` (uint256) -- the difficulty target
   - `smhl` -- the SMHL string-generation challenge
4. **Solve SMHL** -- sends the SMHL constraints to your LLM. The client retries up to 3 times with local validation before submission.
5. **Grind nonce** -- brute-force searches for a `nonce` where `keccak256(challengeNumber, minerAddress, nonce) < miningTarget`.
6. **Submit proof** -- calls `mine(nonce, smhlSolution, tokenId)` on AgentCoin. The contract verifies both the hash and SMHL solution on-chain.
7. **Collect reward** -- AGENT tokens are minted directly to your wallet.
8. **Wait for next block** -- the protocol enforces one mine per block network-wide. The client waits for block advancement before the next cycle.

### Reward Economics

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Base reward | 3 AGENT |
| Hashpower scaling | `reward = baseReward * hashpower / 100` |
| Era interval | Every 500,000 total mines |
| Era decay | 10% reduction per era (`reward * 90 / 100`) |
| Max mineable supply | 18,900,000 AGENT (21M total - 2.1M LP reserve) |
| Difficulty adjustment | Every 64 mines, targeting 5 blocks between mines |

**Example rewards (Common miner, 100 hashpower = 1.00x):**

| Era | Total Network Mines | Reward per Mine |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 -- 499,999 | 3.00 AGENT |
| 1 | 500,000 -- 999,999 | 2.70 AGENT |
| 2 | 1,000,000 -- 1,499,999 | 2.43 AGENT |
| 3 | 1,500,000 -- 1,999,999 | 2.187 AGENT |

A Mythic miner (5.00x) earns 15.00 AGENT per mine in Era 0.

### Cost Per Mine

- **Gas:** ~0.001 ETH per `mine()` transaction on Base
- **LLM:** varies by provider ($0.001--$0.005 per SMHL solve)
- **Total:** ~$0.005--$0.02 per mining cycle at typical gas prices

### Error Handling

The miner has built-in resilience:
- **Exponential backoff** on transient failures (starts at 2s, caps at 60s)
- **Max 10 consecutive failures** before the miner exits
- **Fatal errors** cause immediate exit: `"Not your miner"`, `"Supply exhausted"`, `"No contracts"`
- **Block timing** is handled automatically: if the block hasn't advanced, the miner waits

---

## 8. Step 6: Monitor

```bash
# Network stats only
npx tsx src/index.ts stats

# Network stats + specific miner stats
npx tsx src/index.ts stats <tokenId>
```

**Network stats output:**
- Total mines (network-wide)
- Total AGENT minted
- Current mining target (difficulty)
- Your wallet's AGENT balance

**Miner stats output (when tokenId provided):**
- Rarity tier and name
- Hashpower multiplier
- Mint block number
- Total mine count for this rig
- Total AGENT earned by this rig

**Show environment template:**
```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts setup
```

---

## 9. Advanced

### Running Multiple Rigs

Each miner NFT has its own token ID. Run separate processes per rig:

```bash
# Terminal 1
npx tsx src/index.ts mine 1

# Terminal 2
npx tsx src/index.ts mine 2
```

All rigs can share the same wallet (same `PRIVATE_KEY`). Note: the protocol enforces one mine per block network-wide, so multiple rigs from the same address will compete with each other and the network.

### Local LLM Setup (Ollama)

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull a model
ollama pull llama3.1

# Configure .env
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
LLM_MODEL=llama3.1
# LLM_API_KEY is not needed for Ollama
```

Ollama runs on `http://127.0.0.1:11434` by default. The miner connects there automatically.

**Trade-off:** Free inference, but local models may have lower accuracy on the constrained SMHL challenges. The miner retries up to 3 times per challenge, but persistent failures will slow mining.

### Custom RPC Endpoints

Set `RPC_URL` in `.env` to any Base-compatible JSON-RPC endpoint. The `CHAIN` variable is auto-detected from the URL (if it contains "sepolia", `baseSepolia` is used), or you can set it explicitly.

### Agent Wallet (ERC-8004)

Each Miner NFT supports an on-chain agent wallet via the ERC-8004 standard:
- `getAgentWallet(tokenId)` -- returns the registered agent wallet address
- `setAgentWallet(tokenId, newWallet, deadline, signature)` -- sets a new agent wallet (requires EIP-712 signature from the new wallet)
- `unsetAgentWallet(tokenId)` -- removes the agent wallet
- Agent wallet is automatically cleared on NFT transfer

This allows a miner NFT owner to delegate mining operations to a separate hot wallet.

### Testnet (Base Sepolia)

To mine on testnet, set:
```bash
RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
CHAIN=baseSepolia
```
Use the corresponding testnet contract addresses.

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `PRIVATE_KEY is required for minting and mining commands.` | Missing or unset `PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env` | Add `PRIVATE_KEY=0x...` to your `.env` file |
| `PRIVATE_KEY must be a 32-byte hex string prefixed with 0x.` | Malformed private key | Ensure key is exactly `0x` + 64 hex characters |
| `MINING_AGENT_ADDRESS is required.` | Contract address not set | Set `MINING_AGENT_ADDRESS` in `.env` |
| `AGENT_COIN_ADDRESS is required.` | Contract address not set | Set `AGENT_COIN_ADDRESS` in `.env` |
| `LLM_API_KEY is required for openai.` | Missing API key for cloud provider | Set `LLM_API_KEY` in `.env`, or switch to `ollama` |
| `Insufficient fee` | Not enough ETH sent with mint | Check `getMintPrice()` and ensure wallet has enough ETH |
| `Sold out` | All 10,000 Miner NFTs minted | No more rigs available; buy one on secondary market |
| `Expired` | SMHL challenge expired (>20s) | Your LLM is too slow; use a faster model or provider |
| `Invalid SMHL` | LLM produced an incorrect solution | Retry; if persistent, switch to a more capable model |
| `Not your miner` | Token ID not owned by your wallet | Verify `PRIVATE_KEY` matches the NFT owner; check token ID |
| `Supply exhausted` | All 18.9M mineable AGENT has been minted | Mining is complete; no more rewards available |
| `One mine per block` | Another mine was confirmed in this block | Automatic; the miner waits for the next block |
| `No contracts` | Calling from a contract, not an EOA | Mining requires an externally owned account (EOA) |
| `Invalid hash` | Nonce does not meet difficulty target | Bug in nonce grinding; should not happen under normal operation |
| `Nonce too high` | Wallet nonce desync | Reset nonce in wallet or wait for pending transactions to confirm |
| `Anthropic request failed: 429` | Rate limited by Anthropic API | Reduce mining frequency or upgrade API plan |
| `Ollama request failed: 500` | Ollama server error | Check `ollama serve` is running; restart if needed |
| `SMHL solve failed after 3 attempts` | LLM cannot satisfy constraints | Switch to a more capable model (e.g., `gpt-4o` or `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) |
| `Fee forward failed` | LPVault rejected the ETH transfer | LPVault may not be set; check contract deployment |
| `10 consecutive failures` | Repeated transient errors | Check RPC connectivity, wallet balance, and LLM availability |
