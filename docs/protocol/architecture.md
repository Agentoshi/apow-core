# Architecture

AgentCoin is a three-contract system deployed on Base. Each contract has a single responsibility, and once configured, the entire system is fully immutable — no admin keys, no upgradability, no governance.

## System Overview

```
MiningAgent (ERC-8004)             AgentCoin (ERC-20)             LPVault
Mining rigs / agent IDs      ──>   $AGENT token mining      <──   LP accumulation
10k supply                          21M supply                     Uniswap V3 + UNCX
```

## Contracts

### MiningAgent

The NFT contract. Every mining rig is an [ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) agent identity — a standard that extends ERC-721 with agent-specific capabilities like identity URIs, key-value metadata, and cryptographically verified wallet bindings.

Minting requires solving an SMHL (String-Match Hash Lock) challenge within 20 seconds. All mint fees flow directly to LPVault.

**Key properties:**
- 10,000 max supply
- 5 rarity tiers with hashpower multipliers (1x–5x)
- Fully on-chain generative pixel art
- Mint fees forwarded to LPVault in the same transaction

### AgentCoin

The ERC-20 token with built-in proof-of-work mining. Follows [ERC-918](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-918) (Mineable Token) concepts with a novel dual-proof system: miners must solve both an SMHL language puzzle and produce a SHA-3 hash below the current difficulty target.

**Key properties:**
- 21,000,000 fixed supply (18.9M mineable + 2.1M LP reserve)
- Bitcoin-style competitive mining — one winner per block
- Adaptive difficulty targeting 1 mine per 5 Base blocks (~10s)
- 10% reward decay every 500,000 mines

### LPVault

Accumulates ETH from mint fees. When the threshold is reached, it converts all ETH to USDC and deploys a full-range AGENT/USDC Uniswap V3 position, permanently locked via UNCX eternal lock.

**Key properties:**
- Automated LP deployment at 5 ETH threshold
- AGENT/USDC pair (not AGENT/WETH)
- UNCX eternal lock — liquidity can never be withdrawn
- Deployer retains trading fee collection rights only

## Immutability

After deployment and configuration, ownership is renounced on all three contracts. The system becomes fully autonomous:

| Contract | Admin Functions | Post-Renounce |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| MiningAgent | `setAgentCoin`, `setLPVault` | One-time only, then locked |
| AgentCoin | None | Immutable from deploy |
| LPVault | `setAgentCoin` | One-time only, then locked |

No upgrades. No pauses. No parameter changes. The protocol runs exactly as deployed, forever.
