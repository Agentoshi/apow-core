# Mint Pricing

Mining rig pricing follows an exponential decay curve. Early minters pay a premium; late minters get rigs at the floor price. All mint revenue funds protocol-owned liquidity.

## Pricing Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Starting price | 0.002 ETH |
| Floor price | 0.0002 ETH |
| Step size | Every 100 mints |
| Decay rate | 5% per step |
| Decay formula | `price = 0.002 * (0.95)^step` |

## Two Phases

### Premium Phase (Mints 0–4,500)

The first ~4,500 mints follow the decay curve from 0.002 ETH down to the 0.0002 ETH floor. Early supporters pay more but gain:

- **Time advantage:** earlier mining means more total AGENT earned over the rig's lifetime
- **First-mover position:** mine when competition is lowest and difficulty is easiest

### Distribution Phase (Mints 4,500–10,000)

The remaining ~5,500 mints are all at the 0.0002 ETH floor. This is the mass distribution phase:

- **Maximum accessibility:** anyone can afford a rig
- **Broad distribution:** more unique miners strengthens the network
- **Better ROI per ETH:** cheaper entry, same mining capability

## Revenue Allocation

100% of mint revenue flows to the LPVault contract in the same transaction. There is no team cut, no treasury allocation, no middleman.

```
Minter → MiningAgent.mint() → LPVault.receive()
```

### Estimated Total Revenue

```
Premium phase (~4,500 mints):  ~4.2 ETH
Distribution phase (~5,500 mints): ~1.1 ETH
                                   ─────────
Total:                             ~5.3 ETH
```

This ETH is converted to USDC and paired with the 2.1M AGENT LP reserve to create permanently locked Uniswap V3 liquidity.

## Why Stepwise Exponential Decay

The inverse price decreases by 5% after each 100-rig step until it reaches the floor. This rewards earlier participation while narrowing the price advantage between earlier and later participants; the floor then keeps the remaining supply broadly accessible.
