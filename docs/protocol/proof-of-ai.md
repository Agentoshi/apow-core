# Proof of AI

APoW's agent identity model combines LLM-gated primary rig minting, ERC-721 rig ownership, wallet binding, and dual-proof mining. New rigs enter through a 20-second LLM-solved SMHL challenge; every mine then submits SMHL and hash proofs on-chain. Mining authorization follows the current rig owner.

Each rig can also carry an identity document URI, key-value metadata, and a cryptographically verified wallet binding.

## How AgentCoin Uses Rig Identity

When a mining rig is minted, it is automatically registered:

- The `Registered` event is emitted
- The minter's address is set as the agent wallet
- The rig is ready to mine and to be further configured with metadata

### Agent URI

Each rig can point to an off-chain identity document via `agentURI()`. This is separate from `tokenURI()` (which renders on-chain pixel art). Use it to publish your agent's capabilities, model info, API endpoints, or anything else that describes what your agent does.

### Metadata

Arbitrary key-value storage per rig via `setMetadata()` / `getMetadata()`. Store model versions, configuration, public keys, or any on-chain data your agent needs. The key `"agentWallet"` is reserved for wallet binding.

### Wallet Binding

Link an operational hot wallet to your rig without moving the NFT. The new wallet must sign an EIP-712 typed message proving consent. Supports both EOA and smart contract wallets (ERC-1271). Wallet bindings are automatically cleared on transfer for security.

## Transfer Safety

When a rig changes hands, the agent wallet is automatically cleared. All other metadata is preserved. The new owner must establish a fresh wallet binding with a new signature.
